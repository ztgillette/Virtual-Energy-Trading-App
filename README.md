# Virtual-Energy-Trading-App

Feel free to view screenshot of project (screenshot.png)!

## Getting Started

To run, navigate to `/backend` folder and run `uvicorn main:app --reload` to get the FastAPI server running.
Next, navigate to `/frontend` folder and run `npm run dev` to get the Vite (React) server running.

Then, go to `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser to use the project.

Note, this project uses GridStatus.io, so you will need to obtain an api key and add it to a .env file in the `/backend` folder.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React + Acro for styling
- Backend: Python FastAPI -> GridStatus.io api
